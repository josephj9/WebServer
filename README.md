Developed a fully functional HTTP web server from scratch in C# supporting static file routing, dynamic HTML manipulation, error page handling, session management, and request parsing including query parameters and HTTP verbs.

Implemented a modular routing system and extension-based content loader, enabling configurable error pages, support for various MIME types (HTML, CSS, JS, images), and the ability to override routes and apply custom authorization logic per request.

Engineered a robust request-processing pipeline with exception handling and session control, introducing server-side redirect logic, expired session detection, and extensible request/response manipulation hooks.
